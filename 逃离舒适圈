 First of all,we should know what exactly the comfortable zone is.The Cambridge dictionary defines our comfortable zone as being a behavioural space or situation in which you feel comfortable and do not have to do anything new or difficult.
  There are the fact that quite a few individuals chose to stay in their comfortable zone,but personally l disagree the trend.Step out of you comfortable zone will help you harvest a great deal .Good things donâ€™t stop happening.They will keep happening,and if you let yourself escape from your comfortable zone,even if it feels hard sometimes.Then you will experience all of them. 
  Someone may say get out of the zone will hurt them which discourage them from taking the step.But actually failure is a part of life,scars make you stronger.If you go ahead,soon you will be just as powerful if not more so than all those who choose to stay in the comfortable zone.As for me,when I was in high school,I was afraid of talking to teachers..But I finally became sober when I choose to challenge myself and be the Math lesson representative.
  This is a long-term process.So you just allow yourself leave the zone gradually and you will find life,love and purpose.
